What is Segex?
--------------
Segex was designed to help your lab store, view, and retrieve gene expression
data in one centralized location via the web.

You can use Segex to visualize responses of your microarray probes via basic
graphs, enter and search probe- and gene-specific annotation, or you can perform
sophisticated comparisons of probe sets under different experimental conditions.

Authors
-------
Segex was conceived by David J. Waxman ([Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/))
and developed primarily by Eugene Scherba and Michael McDuffie. Initial work on
the database was done by Eugene Scherba and Katrina Steiling. Niraj Trivedi
contributed some visualization code.
