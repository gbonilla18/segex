*) Write tests

*) Installation: automate file copying: have user provide only two directories:
CGI_ROOT and DOCUMENTS_ROOT. Create the subtree containing css/, images/, and
js/ directories under DOCUMENTS_ROOT and the subtree corresponding to cgi-bin
under CGI_ROOT.

*) Consider using YUI tooltip control to make forms (e.g. Find Probes, Compare
Experiments) more user-friendly.
http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/container/tooltip.html

*) Raphael is now a plugin for YUI 3: http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/raphael
Find out (1) whether changing over to YUI 3 is feasible (seems like it should
be!) and (2) whether Raphael can be used for easy graphing (will probably have
to write own Javascript graphing module).

*) Venn diagrams could be plotted using Raphael. What is needed: optimization
algorithm (implemented in Javascript) for 3-cirlcle diagrams, and something to
show text labels (i.e. how many probes are significant). If done, place
resulting code on Github.

*) Eventually, we need at least two types of database users: segex_basic and
segex_user. segex_user is granted UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, and CREATE TEMPOARY
privileges, while segex_basic is only granted SELECT.

*) Consider using a Tree View instead of multiple levels of dropdown boxes. YUI
has a Tree View control available. Doing so would make sense -- consider the
following hierarchy:
	species -> platform -> study -> experiment
It's four levels deep!

*) Implement breadcrumbs.
