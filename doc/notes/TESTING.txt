http://localhost/cgi-bin/segex/index.cgi?terms=Pcdha1&type=gene&match=full&opts=2&trans=fold&proj=&a=findProbes&b=Search
(search for full gene name "Pcdha1") returns 34 probes on all projects
http://localhost/cgi-bin/segex/index.cgi?terms=pcdha%40&type=gene&match=full&opts=2&trans=fold&proj=&a=findProbes&b=Search

http://localhost/cgi-bin/segex/index.cgi?terms=Pcdha1%2CPcdha6&type=gene&match=full&opts=2&trans=fold&proj=&a=findProbes&b=Search
(search for full gene names entered as "Pcdha1 Pcdha6") returns 35 probes on all
